# VoiceControlledCar
This project is an Android-based racing game developed as part of an assignment. The game allows the player to control a car using voice commands. The player speaks a specific word ("Go") to make the car move forward on a 2D racetrack. The objective is to complete the race before the time runs out (60 seconds).
